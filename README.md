I would add the ability to create a timeline within your own timeline. Why? Because some events have a life of their own. Pictures, comments and likes can come together in a better way to tell the story of that event.

Hey awesome people at Facebook!

Why choose Lou (over the other good-but-not-as-good fish in the sea) for Facebook University?

* I've had experiences most freshmen don't have (with all due respect):
* I've worked in a team (seven people) intensely for two weeks building a web app called [Unipop].
* Me != just books and what I've been taught in class!
* I've worked with all sorts of technology, like Rails, APIs, like testing using RSpec and Cucumber
* I love technology. Click here for photos of my tech escapades.
* I'm fun to have a techquila with

Thank you for considering me for such an exciting opportunity!
